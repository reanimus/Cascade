# Cascade
**Cascade** is a concept for a Cocoa frontend for various Bittorrent daemons. Currently, only rtorrent connectivity is being planned/coded, but the design will allow for easy extensibility with other torrent daemons (such as Deluge, Transmission, etc.)

This is a pet project of mine, and while I'll try to fix any issues I can, this is **not** production-quality software. Critical, disruptive bugs will be addressed as quickly as possible, but consider this **alpha-quality** software.

## Features
None yet! Cascade is currently in more of a planning/experimental phase. This list will be updated as it progresses.

## Building
*TODO: Add build instructions!*
